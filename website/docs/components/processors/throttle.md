Throttles the throughput of a pipeline to a maximum of one message batch per
period. This throttle is per processing pipeline, and therefore four threads
each with a throttle would result in four times the rate specified.

```yml
# Config fields, showing default values
label: ""
throttle:
  period: 100us
```

The period should be specified as a time duration string. For example, '1s'
would be 1 second, '10ms' would be 10 milliseconds, etc.

### Alternatives

It's recommended that you use the [`rate_limit` processor](/docs/components/processors/rate_limit) instead.

## Fields

### `period`

The period to throttle to.


Type: `string`  
Default: `"100us"`
