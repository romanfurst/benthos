:::caution EXPERIMENTAL
This component is experimental and therefore subject to change or removal outside of major version releases.
:::
Executes a find query and creates a message for each row received.

Introduced in version 3.64.0.

```yml
# Config fields, showing default values
input:
  label: ""
  mongodb:
    url: ""
    database: ""
    collection: ""
    username: ""
    password: ""
    query: ""
```

Once the rows from the query are exhausted this input shuts down, allowing the pipeline to gracefully terminate (or the next input in a [sequence](/docs/components/inputs/sequence) to execute).
