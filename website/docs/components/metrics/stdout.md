Prints aggregated metrics as JSON objects to stdout.

```yml
# Config fields, showing default values
metrics:
  stdout:
    push_interval: ""
    static_fields:
      '@service': benthos
    flush_metrics: false
  mapping: ""
```

When Benthos shuts down all aggregated metrics are printed. If a
`push_interval` is specified then metrics are also printed
periodically.

## Fields

### `push_interval`

An optional period of time to continuously print metrics.


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

### `static_fields`

A map of static fields to add to each flushed metric object.


Type: `object`  
Default: `{"@service":"benthos"}`  

### `flush_metrics`

Whether counters and timing metrics should be reset to 0 each time metrics are printed.


Type: `bool`  
Default: `false`
