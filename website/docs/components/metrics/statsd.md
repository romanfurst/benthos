Pushes metrics using the [StatsD protocol](https://github.com/statsd/statsd).
Supported tagging formats are 'none', 'datadog' and 'influxdb'.

```yml
# Config fields, showing default values
metrics:
  statsd:
    address: localhost:4040
    flush_period: 100ms
    tag_format: none
  mapping: ""
```

The underlying client library has recently been updated in order to support
tagging.

The 'network' field is deprecated and scheduled for removal. If you currently
rely on sending Statsd metrics over TCP and want it to be supported long term
please [raise an issue](https://github.com/Jeffail/benthos/issues).
